Roll some dice
---

A simple hubot script that listens for the following strings in chat

    @hubot roll
    @hubot roll 2d6

The script understands basic dice notation, with a few modifiers.

    d6
    d6 + 2
    4d6k3 - 1
    d4 + 2d12 + 3d3
    4d6dl2r1 + 8
    
You can also ask hubot to output the syntax for rolls
